This project was made over a weekend and attempts to merge a traditional city builder with procedural elements, not unlike what you would see in a roguelike. To this end, you place buildings and manage your population's needs. Everytime you place a building you get a new selection of buildings to place. Once a building is placed it cannot be removed. The civilians' needs are dynamically recalculated each time a new building is placed.

This project is a bit rough around the edges and lacks basic quality of life features such as: resetting, and confirming to the player that no more buildings can legally be placed. However, the purpose of this project was to be a small-scoped proof-of-concept. To that end, I believe this idea could show potential with some iteration. Perhaps the concept could be spun into a puzzle city builder.
